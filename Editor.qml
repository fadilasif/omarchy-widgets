  //
  // It is the desktop surface's opposite: on top instead of underneath, and
  // made of input instead of free of it. What makes the two line up is that
  // both use `exclusiveZone: 0`, so their coordinate origins are the same point
  // below the bar, and both ask Model for cell rectangles rather than computing
  // their own — the cell you drop into is the cell that gets drawn.

  // Dragging is done by hand rather than with Drag/DropArea. A drag here starts
  // on one of three surfaces (a card on the grid, a tile in the tray) and can
  // end on any of them, and a manual grab is the only way to keep one gesture
  // in charge across all of it while the drop target changes underneath.
